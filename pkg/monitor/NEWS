Changes in monitor version 2007.4-1

   o	This package was previously in the dseplus bundle in the devel area 
	of CRAN. As of R-2.5.0 CRAN is removing the devel area. The dseplus 
	bundle is being unbundle and individual packages put in the contrib 
	area of CRAN. Some of the packages in dseplus will be incorporated 
	in others, and releasing others may be postponed until they are 
	cleaned up better. 

   o	To the (possibly very small) extent that there is any older news on 
	this package, it will have been included in the NEWS for the main 
	dse bundle on CRAN.
 
   o	package separated from the dseplus bundle.
