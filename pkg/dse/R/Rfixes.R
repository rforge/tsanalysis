#  misc R fixes and additions

#########################

#  For multivariate series the array dim from ar does not work very well with 
#  DSE, but that is considered a "feature" by the maintainer of ts so the
#  fix for ar in ts library is permanently moved to dse1 and called DSE.ar. 

# There are no other temporary R fixes
