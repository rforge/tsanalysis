Package: EvalEst
Version: 2021.2-1
Title: Dynamic Systems Estimation - Extensions
Description:  Provides functions for evaluating (time series) model
	estimation methods. These facilitate Monte Carlo experiments of repeated
	simulations and estimations. Also provides methods for
	looking at the distribution of the results from these experiments,
	including model roots (which are an equivalence class invariant).
Depends: R (>= 2.5.0), tfplot, dse (>= 2007.10-1)
