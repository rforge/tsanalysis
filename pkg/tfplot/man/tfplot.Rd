\details{
    In many cases these are the same as plot methods, however, tfplot puts
    different series in the object \code{x} in different plot panels, whereas
    \code{plot} usually puts them in the same panel. For this reason,
    \code{tfplot} tends to work better when the scale of the different series
    are very different. If additional objects are supplied, then they should
    each have the same number of series as \code{x} and all corresponding series
    will be plotted in the same panel.
    
    \code{tfplot} provides an alternate generic mechanism for plotting time
    series data. New classes of time series may define
    there own \code{tfplot} (and \code{plot}) methods.
    
    
    \code{tfplot} does calls to \code{tfOnePlot} for each panel.
    \code{tfOnePlot} may give slightly better control, especially in cases
    where all series are to go on one plot. The functions are intended to 
    provide a convenient way to do some usual things. Ultimately
    \code{tfOnePlot} calls \code{plot}, \code{title}, and \code{mtext}, so
    even more control of plot details can be achieved by calling those
    functions directly.
    
    The \code{start} and \code{end} arguments to \code{tfplot} 
    determine the start and end of the plot. The argument \code{tf} is an
    alternate way to specify the start and end. It is ignored 
    if \code{start} and \code{end} are specified.

    If \code{xlim} and \code{ylim} are not NULL they should be a vector of two
    elements giving the max and min, which are applied to all graphs, or a list
    of length equal to the number of series to be plotted with each list element
    being the two element vector for the corresponding plot limits. 
    
    \code{Xaxis} provides a mechanism to try and achieve a better default axis.
    If equal 'auto' then an attempt is made at a format with large tick marks for
    years and smaller tick marks for periods (months or quarters). If the number of
    years is sufficiently small, so there is enough space, then period indications
    are added. The default, indicated by \code{L1=NULL}, is the c('Q1', Q2', Q3',
    'Q4') will be used for quarterly data and 
    c("J","F","M","A","M","J","J","A","S","O","N","D") for monthly data. Different
    values can be specified by setting \code{L1}. It should be the same length
    as the frequency of \code{x}. If \code{Xaxis} is set to 
    \code{NULL} then the result is to use plot defaults (as prior to the addition of
    the \code{Xaxis} argument in version 2013.11-1).
    Currently \code{Xaxis='auto'} only affects annual, monthly, and quarterly data,
    and the affect on annual data is marginal.

    The \code{title} is not put on the plot if the global option
    PlotTitles is FALSE. This can be set with \code{options(PlotTitles=FALSE)}. 
    This provides a convenient  mechanism to omit all titles when the title
    may be added separately (e.g. in Latex).
    
    Similarly, \code{options(PlotPlotSubtitles=FALSE)},
    \code{options(PlotSources=FALSE)}, and
    \code{options(PlotFootnotes=FALSE) can be used to suppress printing of 
    these.}
    
    Footnotes can contain \code{"\n"} to produce multiline, or multiple
    footnotes. However, if  \code{source} and \code{lastObs} are speciied then
    the overlap can be messy. In this case a better result might be obtained by
    specifying the source as part of the footnote.
    
    If \code{subtitle}, \code{source}, \code{footnoteLeft}, \code{footnoteRight}
    or \code{legend.loc} have length less than the number of panels then they
    are replicated, so typically they should have one element that is applied 
    to each panel, or be vectors with one element for each panel.
    For \code{tfOnePlot} these should all have length \code{1}.
    If \code{legend} is a matrix then a column will be used for each panel,
    otherwise the vector will be passed to each panel. (Typically this vector
    has length equal to the number of series in each panel graph.)
