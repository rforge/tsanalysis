Changes in curve version 2007.4-1

   o	This package was previously in the dseplus bundle in the devel area of 
	CRAN. As of R-2.5.0 CRAN is removing the devel area. The dseplus bundle 
	is being unbundle and individual packages put in the contrib area of 
	CRAN. Some of the packages in dseplus will be incorporated in others, 
	and releasing others may be postponed until they are cleaned up better. 

   o	To the (possibly very small) extent that there is any older news on 
	this package, it will have been included in the NEWS for the dse 
	bundle on CRAN.

   o	package separated from the dseplus bundle.
