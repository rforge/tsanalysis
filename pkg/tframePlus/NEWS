   o	Added argument dateHeader to TSwriteXLS.

   o	Fixed bug in TSwriteXLS with rounding problem causing incorrectly 
	mapping of some ts dates into correct month.

Changes in tframePlus version 2009.02-1

   o	Cleaned up consistent with tframe so that data classes are not defined 
	unless absolutely necessary. 

   o	Also, in line with trying to use methods for existing classes, 
	seriesNames() now uses dimnames[[2]] for matrices, and a class method if
	that is available. A "seriesNames" attribute is still set if there is
	no class methods available, as for vectors.

   o	removed a try-error check for a condition that would never happen.

   o	added tfI for mulivariate series integration.


Changes in tframePlus version 2008.5-1

   o	First release. This package splits some new/experimental/less stable
	pieces out of tframe. It also include extensions for zoo and its, so 
	the core tframe package does not need them. For older NEWS see the 
	tframe NEWS file.
