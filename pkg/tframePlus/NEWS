Known Bugs

   o	changeTSrepresentation() has requireNamespace("zoo") but there seem to be some
   	conditions when require("zoo") is needed. (Package zoo needs to overwrite the
	as.Date() generic since there is no default for the origin in the
	as.Date.numeric() method.
	
   o	A NOTE regarding no visible global function definition for tfstart and tfend
   	is produced in CRAN checks because of a bug in S4.

   o	Added methods and tests for xts series.

   o	Added argument dateHeader to TSwriteXLS.

   o	Fixed bug in TSwriteXLS with rounding problem causing incorrectly 
	mapping of some ts dates into correct month.

   o	Added perl functionality test.

Changes in tframePlus version 2009.02-1

   o	Cleaned up consistent with tframe so that data classes are not defined 
	unless absolutely necessary. 

   o	Also, in line with trying to use methods for existing classes, 
	seriesNames() now uses dimnames[[2]] for matrices, and a class method if
	that is available. A "seriesNames" attribute is still set if there is
	no class methods available, as for vectors.

   o	removed a try-error check for a condition that would never happen.

   o	added tfI for mulivariate series integration.


Changes in tframePlus version 2008.5-1

   o	First release. This package splits some new/experimental/less stable
	pieces out of tframe. It also include extensions for zoo and its, so 
	the core tframe package does not need them. For older NEWS see the 
	tframe NEWS file.
