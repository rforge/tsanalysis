The original monitor files are 

combmon.R   simpmon.R  tagmat.R and 
combmon.help  simpmon.help  tagmat.help

The files  seriesIDs.R  and seriesIDs.Rd  are a partially attempt
to replace tfpadi and TSpadi with something more meaninful to use
on top of TSdbi.

The files
BOCfm.R  dsepadi.R tfpadi.R and 
BOCfm.help  dsepadi.help  tfpadi.help

are moved from dsepadi (and padi?) via  temporary aborted attempt at a
package dseTSdbi (which eventually seemed unnecessary). 
Most (but not all) of these can probably be cleaned out/up.
The NAMESPACE file also includes thes functions.
